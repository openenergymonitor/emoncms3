Emoncms3 is translated by the GNU gettext method of php.
To add support for another language, simply follow these steps:
	- Download and install poEdit from http://www.poedit.net/
	- Dowload the emoncms3 project files
	- After running poEdit, go to File -> New catalog…
	- In the 'Settings' dialog, enter emoncms3 as project name, UTF-8 charset
	- At folder tab use . as root directory and add above ../../.. to folders so you can have a relative path for future use
	- Create a directory with the name (language)_(COUNTRY) with 2 letters both (example: es_ES for [es]pañol de [ES]PAÑA)
	- Save the catalog with the name app.mo in the directory LC_MESSAGES into the previous directory
	- Refresh/scan the catalog, obtaining the words and expressions to be translated
	- Translate them to the language to add and save the catalog (you should have app.mo and app.po files)
	- You should restart your webserver to see the changes
